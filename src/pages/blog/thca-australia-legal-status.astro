            <h2>What is THCA?</h2>
            <p>THCA (Tetrahydrocannabinolic Acid) is a <strong>non-psychoactive cannabinoid</strong> found in raw, fresh cannabis plants. It's actually the precursor to THC—the compound responsible for cannabis's psychoactive effects.</p>
            <p>In living cannabis plants, THC doesn't exist in significant amounts. Instead, the plant produces THCA, which only converts to THC when exposed to heat through a process called <strong>decarboxylation</strong>.</p>

              <h4>Why the Difference Matters:</h4>
              <p>Because THCA is non-psychoactive in its raw form, some argue it should be treated differently from THC under drug laws. However, THCA easily converts to THC with heat, which complicates its legal classification in most jurisdictions, including Australia.</p>

          <!-- Potential Benefits -->
          <section id="benefits">
            <h2>Potential Benefits of THCA</h2>
            <p>Research on THCA is still in early stages, but preliminary studies suggest it may have several therapeutic properties. Here's what current research indicates:</p>

                <h3>Anti-Inflammatory</h3>
                <p>Studies suggest THCA may have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially helpful for conditions like arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

                <h3>Anti-Nausea</h3>
                <p>Some studies suggest THCA may help reduce nausea and vomiting, potentially more effectively than THC for some patients.</p>
              </div>

            <div class="warning-box">
              <h4>⚠️ Research Disclaimer</h4>
              <p>Most THCA research is preclinical (laboratory or animal studies). More human clinical trials are needed before definitive claims can be made about therapeutic benefits. This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.</p>

            <h2>THCA Legal Status in Australia</h2>

            <div class="alert-box red">
              <h4>⚖️ Current Legal Status</h4>
              <p><strong>THCA is effectively treated as a controlled substance in Australia.</strong> While THCA itself is non-psychoactive, Australian drug laws consider it alongside THC due to its easy conversion potential.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Under Australian law, cannabis and its derivatives are controlled under the <strong>Therapeutic Goods Act</strong> and various state/territory drug legislation. The classification typically includes cannabinoids and their precursors, which encompasses THCA. For official information, refer to the <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/medicinal-cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)</a>.</p>

            <div class="info-box gray">
              <h3>Key Legal Considerations:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>📋 <strong>Scheduled Substance:</strong> Cannabis and its components (including THCA) are scheduled substances</li>
                <li>💊 <strong>Medical Access:</strong> THCA products can theoretically be accessed through medical cannabis pathways</li>
                <li>🚫 <strong>Recreational Use:</strong> Illegal in all Australian states and territories</li>
                <li>🔄 <strong>Conversion Issue:</strong> Because THCA converts to THC, authorities treat it similarly</li>
                <li>🧪 <strong>Drug Testing:</strong> May trigger positive results for THC metabolites</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box blue">
              <h3>International Context: US THCA "Loophole"</h3>
              <p>In the United States, some argue that THCA products derived from hemp (containing less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC) are legal under the 2018 Farm Bill. This has led to a market for THCA flower and products in some US states.</p>
              <p><strong>This loophole does not apply in Australia.</strong> Australian law doesn't make the same hemp/cannabis distinction that would allow THCA products to circumvent cannabis regulations.</p>

            <h2>Decarboxylation: THCA to THC</h2>
            <p><strong>Decarboxylation</strong> is the chemical process that converts THCA into psychoactive THC. This happens when cannabis is exposed to heat—which is why smoking, vaping, or cooking cannabis produces its characteristic effects.</p>

                <summary>Does THCA get you high?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">No. THCA is non-psychoactive and doesn't produce the "high" associated with THC. However, if THCA is heated, it converts to psychoactive THC.</div>
              </details>
              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is THCA legal in Australia?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">THCA falls under cannabis regulations in Australia and is treated similarly to THC. Legal access is only available through medical cannabis pathways with appropriate prescriptions.</div>
              </details>
              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Will THCA show up on a drug test?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">Possibly yes. THCA can convert to THC in your body, and some tests may cross-react with THCA. If you're subject to drug testing, using THCA products carries significant risk.</div>
              </details>
              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What's the difference between THCA and THC?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">THCA is the acidic precursor to THC found in raw cannabis. It's non-psychoactive. When heated, THCA loses its carboxyl group and becomes THC, which is psychoactive.</div>

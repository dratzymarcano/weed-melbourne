          <div class="intro-text">
            <p>Looking for the <strong>strongest weed strains</strong> available in Australia? Whether you're seeking powerful pain relief, intense relaxation, or just want to know what's considered top-shelf cannabis, this guide covers the most potent strains for 2026.</p>
            <p>With THC levels continuing to rise through selective breeding, today's <strong>high THC strains</strong> can reach potencies that were unheard of just a decade ago. Let's explore the strongest cannabis strains and what makes each one unique.</p>

            <p>High-THC strains are recommended for experienced cannabis users only. If you're new to cannabis, start with lower THC strains (10-15% THC) and work your way up gradually. The effects of strong strains can be overwhelming for beginners.</p>

            <h2>Understanding THC Levels</h2>
            <p>THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. The higher the THC percentage, the stronger the psychoactive effects. Here's a general guide to THC levels:</p>
